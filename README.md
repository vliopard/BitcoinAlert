#Bitcoin Alert

*This Chrome Extension alerts when bitcoin values change.*

Just set up the interval time, percentage and minimum value to be alerted.

##How it works:
This software starts monitoring bitcoin values. Every time your value is reached it will keep you aware.

##How to install:
1.) Download [BitcoinAlert.crx](https://github.com/vliopard/BitcoinAlert/blob/master/BitcoinAlert.crx?raw=true) to your computer.

2.) Go to your Chrome Browser and write chrome://extensions/ into your address bar. Hit enter and your extensions area will appear. Or alternatively you can go to Menu > More tools > Extensions.

3.) Drag BitcoinAlert.crx file and drop it to your Google Chrome Extensions Area.

##How to run:
After installing BitcoinAlert into your Google Chrome Browser an icon will appear into your Extensions Bar.

You can force BitcoinAlert to check values by clicking on its icon.

**Other options:**

- You can set the minimum value you want to be informed when reached.

- You can change percentage and the time interval for consulting rates.

##Warning

This software is provided as is, so use it at your own risk.

It will not damage your computer but may fail while informing you the bitcoin rates.

Source code is available here, so if you are unsatisfied, improve it yourself.

I would be happy to have your collaboration on this project.

Thanks for understanding.
